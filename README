HiSilicon Poplar Tools

This git repository contains code and documentation related to the
HiSilicon Poplar board.  The Poplar board uses a HiSilicon Hi3798cv200
quad core ARM Cortex A53 processor, supporting NEON and multi-core
Mali T720 GPU, and is able to decode 4K UHD data streams at 60 fps.
The Poplar board has:  1GB of RAM; about 8GB of eMMC; an Ethernet
port; an HDMI 2.0a port supporting HDCP 2.2; and other support
including WiFi, Bluetooth, and IR.

The file "build_instructions.md" here describes how to build the
code listed above, and how to package the result into a form that
can be used to perform an initial (or recovery) flash of the code
onto the Poplar board's eMMC storage.
